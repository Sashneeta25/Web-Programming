      Hello and Greetings to you! I am Sashneeta d/o Subahar and this is my page for Web Programming Course. Welcome to my page. Hope you have a nice day. Who do not love a totally strange message from a stranger about something completely random? Yes, I am about to introduce myself briefly. This page is all about myself. I am unapologetically myself. You know that old elevator pitch advice? "You should be able to tell people what you do in the time it takes you to get to the floor you're going to." Well I'll try to introduce myself same as the advice.

      Take your age, Subtract by two, then add two. That's your age! You don't say it. Basically I'm a third year student from Bachelor of Computer Science (BSc Hons) at the National University of Malaysia. Want to hear a joke? "how does a computer gets drunk?" "Answer: It takes screenshots". Apart from Computer Science, i love drawing and dancing. Those are my hobbies. Black is my favourite colour. To describe my character.... Heraclitus once said, "Good character is not formed in a week or a month. It is created little by little, day by day.Protracted and patient effort is needed to develop good character" Thus, i am constantly developing myself and good character.
