      <h1><a href="https://cdn-prod.medicalnewstoday.com/content/images/articles/325/325105/mauritius-from-the-air.jpg">Mauritius</a></h1>
      <p>Mauritius, an Indian Ocean island nation, is known for its beaches, lagoons and reefs. I love the view and serenity there. I wish to visit Mauritius some day.</p>
      <h2><a href="https://www.riotgames.com/darkroom/1440/b2b587d91d3c5d2922953ac62fbb2cb8:dfd0d5c2d07f981fb8cda29623b5e54e/paris.jpg">Paris</a></h2>
      <p>Among the long list of things the city of Paris is known for, its nickname as the City of Love is the most romantic.</p>
      <h3><a href="https://lp-cms-production.imgix.net/2021-06/The_Colosseum_Rome.jpg?auto=format&fit=crop&sharp=10&vib=20&ixlib=react-8.6.4&w=850">Italy</a></h3>
      <p>Italy is truly the world's most beautiful country. It flaunts the most inspiring cultural treasures and magnificent scenery, which you cannot find anywhere in the world. Venice, Florence and Rome with their diverse architecture, Tuscany with its rolling hills, vineyards and snow-peaked mountains will mesmerize you.</p>
      <h4><a href="http://thehellenicodyssey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Santorini-53c9e0dca77b.jpg">Santorini</a></h4>
      <p>Santorini is one of the Cyclades islands in the Aegean Sea. It was devastated by a volcanic eruption in the 16th century BC, forever shaping its rugged landscape. The whitewashed, cubiform houses of its 2 principal towns, Fira and Oia, cling to cliffs above an underwater caldera (crater). They overlook the sea, small islands to the west and beaches made up of black, red and white lava pebbles.</p>
      <h5><a href="https://deih43ym53wif.cloudfront.net/zermatt-matterhorn-switzerland-shutterstock_1298208013_44fea015e5.jpeg">Switzerland</a></h5>
      <p>Switzerland is a mountainous Central European country, home to numerous lakes, villages and the high peaks of the Alps. Its cities contain medieval quarters, with landmarks like capital Bern's Zytglogge clock tower and Lucerne's wooden chapel bridge. The country is also known for its ski resorts and hiking trails. I wish to visit Switzerland some day.</p>
      <h6><a href="https://cdn.britannica.com/36/1736-050-3AB11366/Cliffs-of-Moher-coast-County-Clare-Ireland.jpg">Ireland</a></h6>
      <p>The country is blessed with some of the most beautiful natural sceneries in the world. The mild and moist climate of the country contributes to its countryside's green fields and vibrant moss plants. To get an unmatched outdoor experience, take hilltop walks and visit the quiet lakes that can clutter all your worries and unwind your anxiety. Apart from its hills and meadows, Ireland is also known for its sandy beaches and rocky coastlines.</p>
